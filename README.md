# JS Data Structures


## Description
**JavaScript Data Structures** a repo for data structures and algorithms. This collection holds sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in JavaScript (and coffeescript), including:

* doubly-linked lists: A list is instantiated with a head and a tail that both point to Null. New nodes can be added to the list with a value using the add method; the most recent node added becomes the tail.

* binary search tree: This search tree method contains two constructor functions: binary search tree and null binary search tree (for ease in traversing). A tree is initialized with a specified value and a left and right are assigned to Null Binary Trees until replaced using the "insert" method.
